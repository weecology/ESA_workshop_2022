## Welcome to the Workshop material

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/weecology/ESA_workshop_2022/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.









### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/weecology/ESA_workshop_2022/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
